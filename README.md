# iWedding
iWedding is a drawing board app particularly designed to run on the devices with big-size and touch-enabled screens, powered with Flash and AIR. Originally it was designed back in 2012 for my colleague Will's wedding, the guests can leave their wishes, greetings or whatever words and drawings on the digital board and save the whole canvas as an image.

Below are the interfaces:
