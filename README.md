# iWedding
iWedding is a drawing board app particularly designed to run on those devices with big-size and touch-enabled screen, powered with Flash and AIR. Originally it was designed for my colleague Will's wedding for fun, the guests can leave their wishes and greetings or whatever words on the board and save the whole canvas as a image.

Below are the interfaces:
